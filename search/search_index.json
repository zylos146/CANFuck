Where possible it is recommended that you use the features the frameworks supplies. These are documented in this section and a comprehensive example is provided by the demo project.</p> <p>The following diagram visualizes how the framework's modular components fit together, each feature is described in detail below.</p> <p></p> <p>The StatefulService.h class is responsible for managing state. It has an API which allows other code to update or respond to updates in the state it manages. You can define a data class to hold state, then build a StatefulService class to manage it. After that you may attach HTTP endpoints, WebSockets or MQTT topics to the StatefulService instance to provide commonly required features.</p> <p>Here is a simple example of a state class and a StatefulService to manage it:</p> <pre><code>class LightState {\npublic:\nbool on = false;\nuint8_t brightness = 255;\n};\n\nclass LightStateService : public StatefulService&lt;LightState&gt; {\n};\n</code></pre> <p>You may listen for changes to state by registering an update handler callback. It is possible to remove an update handler later if required.</p> <pre><code>// register an update handler\nupdate_handler_id_t myUpdateHandler = lightStateService.addUpdateHandler(\n[&amp;](const String&amp; originId) {\nSerial.print(\"The light's state has been updated by: \");\nSerial.println(originId);\n}\n);\n\n// remove the update handler\nlightStateService.removeUpdateHandler(myUpdateHandler);\n</code></pre> <p>An \"originId\" is passed to the update handler which may be used to identify the origin of an update. The default origin values the framework provides are:</p> Origin Description http An update sent over REST (HttpEndpoint) mqtt An update sent over MQTT (MqttPubSub) websocket:{clientId} An update sent over WebSocket (WebSocketRxTx) <p>StatefulService exposes a read function which you may use to safely read the state. This function takes care of protecting against parallel access to the state in multi-core environments such as the ESP32.</p> <pre><code>lightStateService.read([&amp;](LightState&amp; state) {\ndigitalWrite(LED_PIN, state.on ? HIGH : LOW); // apply the state update to the LED_PIN\n});\n</code></pre> <p>StatefulService also exposes an update function which allows the caller to update the state with a callback. This function automatically calls the registered update handlers if the state has been changed. The example below changes the state of the light (turns it on) using the arbitrary origin \"timer\" and returns the \"CHANGED\" state update result, indicating that a change was made:</p> <pre><code>lightStateService.update([&amp;](LightState&amp; state) {\nif (state.on) {\nreturn StateUpdateResult::UNCHANGED; // lights were already on, return UNCHANGED\n}\nstate.on = true;  // turn on the lights\nreturn StateUpdateResult::CHANGED; // notify StatefulService by returning CHANGED\n}, \"timer\");\n</code></pre> <p>There are three possible return values for an update function which are as follows:</p> Origin Description StateUpdateResult::CHANGED The update changed the state, propagation should take place if required StateUpdateResult::UNCHANGED The state was unchanged, propagation should not take place StateUpdateResult::ERROR There was an error updating the state, propagation should not take place"},{"location":"statefulservice/#serialization","title":"Serialization","text":"<p>When reading or updating state from an external source (HTTP, WebSockets, or MQTT for example) the state must be marshalled into a serializable form (JSON).
